      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>
        This starter brings together, Gatsby, TailwindCSS and NetlifyCMS to make
        it simple to create a site with static generation, flexible styling and
        dynamic posts driven by Markdown.
      </p>
      <h3>Tailwind</h3>
      <p>
        It provides a simple tailwind configuration which is responsive and easy
        to either extend, or throw away and start over.
      </p>
      <h3>Netlify CMS</h3>
      <p>
        We include a Netlify configuration which allows you to use Netlify CMS
        to generate posts with some straight-forward fields which are at their
        heart just Markdown files hosted on Github.
      </p>
